# Pythia_FastJet_ROOT
Hi! My name is Jenn (she/her/hers).
I am a part of the sPHENIX Collaboration working at Vanderbilt.
This is my GitHub where I will post codes, commands, definitions, macros, etc. relative to sPHENIX.

I hope to contribute to jet-substructure analysis in heavy ion collisions.
I am currently coding Monte-Carlo models to STAR data [as of 11/28/22]
